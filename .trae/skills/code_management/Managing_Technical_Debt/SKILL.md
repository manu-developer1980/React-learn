# Managing Technical Debt

## Overview
Technical debt is inevitable but must be managed to prevent project stagnation.

## Strategies
1. **Identification**: Track debt items in the backlog (e.g., with a "tech-debt" label).
2. **Allocation**: Dedicate a percentage of time (e.g., 20%) in each sprint to addressing debt.
3. **Boy Scout Rule**: "Leave the code better than you found it." Refactor slightly when touching a file.
4. **Documentation**: Document *why* a shortcut was taken (e.g., `// TODO: Refactor this when X is ready`).
