# Code Review Guidelines

## Overview
Effective code reviews improve code quality and facilitate knowledge sharing.

## For Reviewers
- **Be constructive**: Focus on the code, not the person.
- **Check logic**: Look for bugs, edge cases, and security issues.
- **Style**: Let automated tools handle formatting.
- **Response time**: Review within 24 hours if possible.

## For Authors
- **Context**: Provide a clear description and screenshots/videos if UI changes.
- **Small PRs**: Keep changes focused and small (< 400 lines).
- **Self-review**: Review your own code before assigning others.
