# Changelog Maintenance

## Overview
A changelog keeps users and contributors informed about notable changes.

## Keep a Changelog
- Follow the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) standard.
- Sections: `Added`, `Changed`, `Deprecated`, `Removed`, `Fixed`, `Security`.

## Automation
- Use `standard-version` or `semantic-release` to generate changelogs from conventional commits.
