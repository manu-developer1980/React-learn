# Frontend-Backend Communication Patterns

## Overview

How the client and server exchange data.

## Patterns

1. **REST**: Resource-based, standard HTTP verbs. Good for caching and simplicity.
2. **GraphQL**: Client specifies data requirements. Good for complex relational data and minimizing over-fetching.
3. **WebSockets**: Full-duplex communication. Essential for real-time chat, notifications.
4. **gRPC**: High-performance RPC using Protocol Buffers. Good for microservices.
5. **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**: Server pushes updates to client (one-way).
