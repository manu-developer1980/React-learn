# Stack Selection Criteria

## Overview

Choosing the right technology stack is a critical early decision.

## Factors to Consider

1. **Team Expertise**: What does the team already know?
2. **Project Requirements**: Real-time? High traffic? Mobile?
3. **Ecosystem & Community**: Library availability, support, hiring pool.
4. **Performance**: Speed, scalability, resource usage.
5. **Time to Market**: Rapid prototyping vs. long-term stability.

## Decision Matrix

Create a weighted matrix to score options against these factors.
